[A note on the unbiased estimation of mutual information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08682)  
Jake Witter, Conor Houghton  
Estimators for mutual information are typically biased. However, in the case of the Kozachenko-Leonenko estimator for metric spaces, a type of nearest neighbour estimator, it is possible to calculate the bias explicitly.
